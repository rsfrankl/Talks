## What we talk about when we talk about [*disruptions*]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"} in spatial data science {.center}

## What we talk about when we talk about [*disruptions*]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"} in spatial data science

-   Obvious disruptions

-   Other, less obvious, disruptions

-   A secret third type of disruptions that keep Rachel up at night

## Some obvious disruptions

-   [Data]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"}---new, big, at scale
-   [Methods]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"}---AI, GeoAI, Spatial Data Science, Urban Analytics, etc
-   [Computational ease]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"}---real time, multiscalar, at scale\
    \
    \

###### my guess is we will discuss these exhaustively

## Other less obvious disruptions

-   [Openness]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"}---for better...and maybe (?) sometimes for worse...
-   [Closure]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"}---of state borders, as well as data access and ownership
-   [Inclusion]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"}---the *who*, *what*, and *where* of research\
    \
    \

###### what matters more: *what* we do or *how* we do it? (answer: both)

## Disruptions that keep Rachel up at night

-   [Data disappearance]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"}---the old and the new
-   [Conceptual + ontological drift]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"}---whether we're measuring what we think we're measuring\*
-   [Easy science]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"}---separating the scientific wheat from the chaff\
    \
    \

###### \*many of the basic precepts we organise our data and methods around are rapidly evolving: e.g., gender, household structure, place of work, employment, race/ethnicity

# Other late-night worries

## Distinguishing between [*disruptive science*]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"} and [*science disruption*]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"}

## What can go wrong when we privilege [*disruptive*]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"} science {.center}

makers *versus* carers

breakers *versus* maintainers

## The mischaracterisation of political/social problems as [*research problems*]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"}

time, resources, and policy attention devoted to technical and research investment rather than investment in actual change

## ~~GIScience~~ [*solutions*]{style="background-color: #E9BDB4"}

-   Answer is more than *more* AI or *more* openness or *more* new names
-   A piece of the answer *is* definitely data, however
-   Knowing when to stay in our lane and when to swerve
-   And policy
-   And disciplinary solidarity\
