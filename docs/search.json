Data for all–data distribution channels that meet researchers and policymakers where they are, with user-friendly interfaces, familiar file formats, linkage and integration with existing data resources\n3. Capability and community–building capacity for understanding and working with imagery and imagery-derived data, growing the user-base and providing thought leadership, and heightening awareness and enthusiasm for the value of imagery\n\n\n\n\n\n*Code name: Imago"

Do we draw boundaries? Build walls? Moats?\nI’d love to see us all talking to each other more"
